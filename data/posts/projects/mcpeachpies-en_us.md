# mcpeachpies' website

This is the website I built and designed for mcpeachpies. He told me some sections he'd like on the page and gave me full control of the design process. We iterated sections and ideas over time, and ended up with this.

The website is available on [mcpeachpies.existencesmp.com](https://mcpeachpies.existencesmp.com)

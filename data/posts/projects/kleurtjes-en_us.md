# Kleurtj.es

This project is a remake of an older site I built before. I was not satisfied with that site, since it had various UX issues, so I built this.

This project is built using Node.js, with MongoDB as a database. Express is used as the web server, using express-handlebars as the view engine.

The project is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jipfr/colors-new). The site is also available at [kleurtj.es](https://kleurtj.es/jip)

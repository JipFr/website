# Adolla

Adolla is a web app I built to read manga. I was told there weren't any decent ones that worked for iOS, so I built it myself.

The project features progress tracking, lists, backups, a customizable reader, search, proper iOS standalone support, Telegram integration for new chapteers, and it is also a PWA.

The project is made with Node on the back-end with Handlebars as the templating engine. 

The source code and instructions for getting the project up and running are available [here](https://github.com/JipFr/Adolla).

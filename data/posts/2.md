# Why cats are the best

breeding of cats for sale - updating the law to control the breeding and sale of cats to reduce the number of unwanted kittens. We recommend new regulations under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 to regulate the commercial breeding and sale of cats - 94.5% agreed with this
microchipping of cats - making it compulsory to microchip owned cats. We'd like to see regulations to introduce compulsory microchipping of owned cats. More needs to be done to raise awareness among cat owners of the benefits of microchipping as the safe and permanent way of identification to help reunite a lost or injured cat with its owner - 93% agreed with this
cats entering the UK - creating a national database to ensure that a central record is kept of all cats entering the UK legally so those entering illegally without a rabies vaccine can be identified without delay. We'd like to see Government guidance for local authorities, trading standards officers, welfare charities and other relevant bodies on procedures to follow if a cat is suspected of being an illegal import - 96% agreed with this
dog attacks on cats - creation of a new offence within legislation governing dangerous dogs where a dog that is out of control attacks, injures or kills a cat - 94% agreed with this
cats and the curriculum - inclusion of animal welfare in the national curriculum so that all children learn about responsible pet care and Government recognition of the preventative impact of teaching animal welfare to schoolchildren - 96%
